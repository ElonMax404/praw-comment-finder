This thing can find post in hot with comments that contain certain words.
Just run it, it will ask several questions and then do it's job.

You must set up your data in "reddit" varible first.

Also, I didn't know how to change the sort, so default it's "hot".
You can change it by setting up it here:

"for submission in subreddit.<controversial/gilded/hot/new/rising/top>(limit=limit):"

It's also kinda messy. 

Enjoy!
